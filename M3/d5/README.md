# Friday Challenge
Implement K-Means from scratch based on this [tutorial with 2D arrays](https://pythonprogramming.net/k-means-from-scratch-machine-learning-tutorial/). 

You can also check the details on the original [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vOKyDRe6mIBTFhdq8d_PfQSfqz_H5dWL/view) in which K-means was proposed! 
*Hint: You read it yesterday :)*
*Double Hint:* It may be better to try using classes. Otherwise, make sure you split it into sub functions -don't try to do all in one sweep-.

# BONUS Challenge:
Make K-Means work for any number of X components (Dimension independent), not just in 2D.
