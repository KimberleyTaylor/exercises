<h1 align="center">Day 2: Data Cleaning (Missings and Outliers)</h1>

## Exercises

### ‚ùì Missing values

#### 1. What is the missing datatype used in pandas?
* numpy.NaN
#### 2. How to replace all occurences of the value 9999 to missing in pandas?
* Use .replace(np.nan, 9999)
#### 3. How to get the absolute number of missings for each variable in pandas?
* Use df.isnull().sum()
#### 4. How to get the percentage of missings for each variable in pandas?
* Use df.isnull().sum()/len(df)
#### 5. How to drop rows with missing values?
* Use df.dropna(axis=0)
#### 6. How to drop variables with missing values?
* Use df.dropna(axis=1)
#### 7. What is the univariate imputation method in sklearn?
* impute.SimpleImputer - this replaces missing values with a constant value or a value realted to a feature. We can use the missing_values parameter to specify the missing value used in the dataset, and the strategy parameter for specifying how the missing value should be replaced.
#### 8. What is the multivariate imputation method in sklearn?
* impute.IterativeImputer - here is variable with missing values is calculated as a function of other variables. Then the missing values can be estimated through this function.
#### 9. What is the best univariate imputation method to categorical variables? (Explain why)
* Replacing with the mode value using SimpleImputer(strategy="most_frequent"), or replacing with a constant value using SimpleImputer(strategy="constant", fill_value=*insert string or numerical value*). These are best because it will give a more real-life estimation of the value, instead of creating a new value which would create a new category.
#### 10. What is the best univariate imputation method to numerical variables? (Explain why)
* Replacing with the mean or median value using IterativeImputer(initial_strategy="mean") or IterativeImputer(initial_strategy="median"). This will calculate a very accurate mean or median value using on estimator functions based on other variables. Therefore, instead of categorising, it will estimate a value specific to the general mean or median of other samples similar to itself.


### üîé Outliers

#### 1. What is an outlier?
* It is a point that is vastly different than the majority of other samples in the dataset. Therefore it creates a different distribution and effects the data in a bias way. To replace or remove an outlier is the best method to deal with this.
#### 2. What is a simple method to detect and deal with outliers of a numerical variable?
* To detect outliers of numerical variables, plot the data. If it is univariate, make a boxplot or splitplot. If it is bivariate, make a scatter plot. If it is multivariate, plot a dimentionality reduction such as TSNE or UMAP.
#### 3. What is novelty detection?
* It gives a confidence level of if **new** data added to a dataset is abnormal or regular or indistinguishable from other features in the original dataset. Therefore we can decide to keep the new data or not.
#### 4. Name 4 advanced methods of outlier detection in sklearn.
* Robust Covariance, One Class SVM, Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor. 


### üñã Typos

#### 1. What is a typo?
* A typographical error - (a spelling mistake)
#### 2. What is a good method of automatically detect typos?
* Use "fuzzywuzzy"


### Practical case

Consider the following dataset: [San Francisco Building Permits](https://www.kaggle.com/aparnashastry/building-permit-applications-data). Look at the columns "Street Number Suffix" and "Zipcode". Both of these contain missing values.

- Which, if either, are missing because they don't exist? **(E)**
- Which, if either, are missing because they weren't recorded? **(R)**

Hint: Do all addresses generally have a street number suffix? Do all addresses generally have a zipcode?
