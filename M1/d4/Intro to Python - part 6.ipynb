    "The interesting difference between these two examples is that in the first example, the string was interpreted as one long, continuous series of characters, while in the second example the different lines are all printed on different lines on the output. The reason that this happens is that there is an invisible character included at the end of each line in the second example that indicates that Python should move to the next line before continuing. This is the so-called \"newline\" character, and you can actually insert it explicitly into a string, using the code \"`\\n`\". So this code should not be read as two characters, the backslash and the \"n\", but as a single newline character. By using it, you can ensure that you print the output on multiple lines, even if you use the backslash to indicate the continuation of the string, as was done in the first example. For example:"

For example, \"`\\x20`\" is the character expressed by the hexadecimal number `20`, which is the same as the decimal number `32`, which is the space (this will be explained later in this chapter).\n",

    "In case you never learned about hexadecimal counting: hexadecimals use a numbering scheme that uses 16 different digits. We use ten (`0` to `9`), binary uses two (`0` to `1`), and hexidecimal then uses `0` to `9` and then continues from `A` to `F`. A direct translation from hexadecimals to decimals turns `A` into `10`, `B` into `11`, etcetera. In decimal counting, the value of a multi-digit number is found by multiplying the digits by increasing powers of `10`, from right to left, e.g., the number `1426` is `6 + 2*10 + 4*100 + 1*1000`. For hexadecimal numbers you do the same thing, but multiply by powers of `16`, e.g., the hexadecimal number `4AF2` is `2 + 15*16 + 10*256 + 4*4096`. Programmers tend to like hexadecimal numbers, as computers work with bytes as the smallest unit of memory storage, and a byte can store 256 different values, i.e., any byte value can be expressed by a hexadecimal number of two digits.

    "`join()` is the opposite of `split()`. `join()` joins a list of words together, separated by a specific separator. This sounds like it would be a method of lists, but for historic reasons it is defined as a string method. Since all string methods are called with the format `<string>.<method>()`, there must be a string in front of the call to `join()`. That string is the separator that you want to use, while the parameter of the method is the list that you want to join together. The return value, as always, is the resulting string.
