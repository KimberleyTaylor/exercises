In daily life, it is far more commonplace to deal with textual information. So are you ever going to learn how to deal with texts?\n\nThe reason that dealing with texts was postponed until this point, is that dealing with numbers is simply easier than dealing with texts. But in the present section, the first steps are taken to learn to manipulate textual information.\n\nTexts, in programming languages, are dealt with in the form of strings. This section is on the details of strings, and on readily-available functions to juggle them.","metadata":{"cell_id":"00002-94b6715f-008f-4347-9936-f91171d647b2","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Multi-line strings","metadata":{"cell_id":"00003-36b54c36-6ca9-4aae-8144-bea491eb16d2","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Strings in Python may span across multiple lines. This can be useful when you have a very long string, or when you want to format the output of the string in a certain way. Multi-line strings can be achieved in two ways:\n\n1. With single or double quotes, and an indication that the remainder of the string continues on the next line with a backslash.\n2. With triple single or double quotes.\n\nI first demonstrate how this works when you use the regular string enclosure with one double or single quote at each end of the string:","metadata":{"cell_id":"00004-239c1bee-72e1-4512-a48e-dd81a26b0f72","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"00005-fe076b4a-0b8f-4a65-8902-927da12509d4","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"longString = \"I'm fed up with being treated like sheep. \\\nWhat's the point of going abroad if you're just another \\\ntourist carted around in buses surrounded by sweaty \\\nmindless oafs from Kettering and Coventry in their \\\ncloth caps and their cardigans and their transistor \\\nradios and their Sunday Mirrors, complaining about \\\nthe tea - 'Oh they don't make it properly here, do they, \\\nnot like at home' - and stopping at Majorcan bodegas \\\nselling fish and chips and Watney's Red Barrel and \\\ncalamaris and two veg and sitting in their cotton frocks \\\nsquirting Timothy White's suncream all over their puffy \\\nraw swollen purulent flesh 'cos they 'overdid it on the first day.\"\nprint(longString)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"I'm fed up with being treated like sheep.

The backslash (`\\`) can actually be included after any Python statement to indicate that it continues on the next line, and it can be quite useful for that, for instance when you write long calculations.\n\nThe recommended way to write multi-line strings in Python is, however, to use triple double or single quotes. I indicated earlier that you can use those to write multi-line comments. Such comments are basically large strings in the middle of your Python program, which do nothing as they are not assigned to a variable.\n\nHere is an example of a long string with triple double quotes:","metadata":{"cell_id":"00006-d631df56-9817-4fbe-9d24-779c0a19b314","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"00007-016f6639-5ec5-481a-be33-4d9b166e95de","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"longString = \"\"\"And being herded into endless Hotel Miramars and Bellevueses \nand Continentales with their modern international luxury \nroomettes and draught Red Barrel and swimming pools full \nof fat German businessmen pretending they're acrobats forming \npyramids and frightening the children and barging into queues \nand if you're not at your table spot on seven you miss the \nbowl of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup, the first item on \nthe menu of International Cuisine, and every Thursday night \nthe hotel has a bloody cabaret in the bar, featuring a tiny \nemaciated dago with nine-inch hips and some bloated fat tart \nwith her hair brylcreemed down and a big arse presenting \nFlamenco for Foreigners.\"\"\"\nprint(longString)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"And being herded into endless Hotel Miramars and Bellevueses \nand Continentales with their modern international luxury \nroomettes and draught Red Barrel and swimming pools full \nof fat German businessmen pretending they're acrobats forming \npyramids and frightening the children and barging into queues \nand if you're not at your table spot on seven you miss the \nbowl of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup, the first item on \nthe menu of International Cuisine, and every Thursday night \nthe hotel has a bloody cabaret in the bar, featuring a tiny \nemaciated dago with nine-inch hips and some bloated fat tart \nwith her hair brylcreemed down and a big arse presenting \nFlamenco for Foreigners.\n"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The interesting difference between these two examples is that in the first example, the string was interpreted as one long, continuous series of characters, while in the second example the different lines are all printed on different lines on the output. The reason that this happens is that there is an invisible character included at the end of each line in the second example that indicates that Python should move to the next line before continuing. This is the so-called \"newline\" character, and you can actually insert it explicitly into a string, using the code \"`\\n`\". So this code should not be read as two characters, the backslash and the \"n\", but as a single newline character.

For example, \"`\\x20`\" is the character expressed by the hexadecimal number `20`, which is the same as the decimal number `32`, which is the space (this will be explained later in this chapter).\n\nIn case you never learned about hexadecimal counting: hexadecimals use a numbering scheme that uses 16 different digits. We use ten (`0` to `9`), binary uses two (`0` to `1`), and hexidecimal then uses `0` to `9` and then continues from `A` to `F`. A direct translation from hexadecimals to decimals turns `A` into `10`, `B` into `11`, etcetera. In decimal counting, the value of a multi-digit number is found by multiplying the digits by increasing powers of `10`, from right to left, e.g., the number `1426` is `6 + 2*10 + 4*100 + 1*1000`. For hexadecimal numbers you do the same thing, but multiply by powers of `16`, e.g., the hexadecimal number `4AF2` is `2 + 15*16 + 10*256 + 4*4096`. Programmers tend to like hexadecimal numbers, as computers work with bytes as the smallest unit of memory storage, and a byte can store 256 different values, i.e., any byte value can be expressed by a hexadecimal number of two digits.
