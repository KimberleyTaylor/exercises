If you don't finish all the exercises, you can work on them tonightor tomorrow. \n\nAt the end of the class, we will upload the code with the solutions of the exercises so that you can review them again if needed. If you still have not finished some exercises, try to do them first by yourself, before taking a look at the solutions: you are doing these exercises for yourself, so it is always the best to do them your way first, as it is the fastest way to learn!","metadata":{"cell_id":"00000-3e5ba727-cfc0-445f-834d-c7ff4c1681ad","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Exercise 1.3 (üå∂Ô∏è):** You look at the clock and see that it is currently 14.00h.

It is popular to sing on long trips, as it has a very repetitive format which is easy to memorize, and can take a long time to sing. The song's simple lyrics are as follows: \"99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.\" The same verse is repeated, each time with one fewer bottle. The song is completed when the singer or singers reach zero. Write a function that generates and prints all the verses of the song (though you might start a bit lower, for instance with 10 bottles). Make sure that your loop is not endless, and that you use the proper inflection for the word \"bottle\".","metadata":{"cell_id":"00003-9f20dba3-eaae-4518-bfae-b3b0019d49b7","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"00004-874c1bb2-6bbb-4de5-8240-24bd912eb2d3","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"a4565e73","execution_start":1607178487140,"execution_millis":1,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"#Your Code Here\ndef beersong(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    5 bottles of beer on the wall, 5 bottles of beer.
